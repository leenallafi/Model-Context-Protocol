# Model Context Protocol (MCP)


# Clarification about the GitHub MCP Server mentioned in the PDF
The PDF contains steps and instructions on how to use the official GitHub MCP server as part of GitHub Copilot or Claude Desktop workflows.

These instructions do not describe a library or code that I used in my project.

The GitHub MCP server is a specific server implementation designed for integration with GitHub Copilot and Claude Desktop.

The PDF is intended as a reference guide to help users understand how to interact with or set up the GitHub MCP server if needed, not as a technical implementation detail of my project.




## Project Overview

This project builds on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by implementing **custom GitHub operations** through modular Python code. It is designed to:

- Provide reusable modules for tasks like **branch management**, **file operations**, **pull requests**, **issues**, and **milestones**.
- Demonstrate how these operations can be **integrated with MCP workflows** or used independently for GitHub automation.
- Support development in environments like **Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot**, making it easier to extend or customize operations.


## Notes on Usage

### Using PyGithub
All GitHub operations in this project are implemented using [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library that provides full access to the GitHub API.  
Refer to its documentation for details on authentication, repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.

### Exposing Functions as MCP Tools
These functions can also be exposed as **tools for AI applications** using [FastMCP](https://github.com/fastmcp/fastmcp).  
This allows AI clients (e.g., Claude, VS Code MCP, ChatGPT MCP) to call these operations directly as part of an MCP workflow.

Example:
- Wrap functions from `src/` as FastMCP tools.
- Register the MCP server.
- Call GitHub operations (e.g., create a branch, open a pull request) directly from an AI-enabled client.


The project structure follows a clean modular design:


model-context-protocol/
├── main.py # Entry point to test or demonstrate GitHub operations
├── .env # Stores GitHub token and other environment variables
└── src/
  ├── init.py # Marks src as a package
  ├── Authentication.py # Handles GitHub authentication (g, token, auth)
  ├── Repository.py # Functions for file operations in repositories
  ├── pullrequest.py # Functions to create/manage pull requests
  ├── branch.py # Branch creation, protection, and listing
  ├── commit.py # Commit-related utilities
  ├── issue.py # Issue creation and commenting
  ├── milestone.py # Milestone retrieval and management
  ├── init.py
|_pdf #Using Copilot and Claude Desktop, this PDF discusses using the GitHub MCP server in Visual Studio Code.


- **`main.py`** contains **sample function calls** to demonstrate usage (e.g., creating files, listing branches).  
- **Each module in `src/`** provides additional operations not shown in the sample, making the system **extensible**.  
- The project can be **integrated with MCP clients** or **used standalone** for GitHub automation.

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to securely connect AI-enabled applications to real-world data, tools, and workflows. MCP enables AI systems to access the context they need—such as files, knowledge bases, and project management tools—without requiring manual data entry or custom integrations.

## Key Features
- **Secure and Standardized**: MCP provides a secure and standardized way for AI applications to interact with external resources.
- **Extensible Ecosystem**: Choose from hundreds of pre-built servers for popular tools like GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, and more. Easily build custom servers for bespoke integrations.
- **Seamless AI Integration**: Configure your AI application (Claude, VS Code, ChatGPT, etc.) to connect to MCP servers and access available tools, resources, and prompts.
- **Real Context, Real Actions**: AI-powered applications can access real data, execute actions, and provide more helpful responses based on your actual context.

## How MCP Works
1. **Choose MCP Servers**: Select from pre-built servers or create your own for custom workflows.
2. **Connect Your AI Application**: Configure your AI tool to connect to MCP servers and discover available resources.
3. **Work With Context**: Your AI application can now access and interact with real data and tools, enhancing its capabilities and usefulness.
