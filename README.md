# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to securely connect AI-enabled applications to real-world data, tools, and workflows. MCP enables AI systems to access the context they need—such as files, knowledge bases, and project management tools—without requiring manual data entry or custom integrations.

## Key Features
- **Secure and Standardized**: MCP provides a secure and standardized way for AI applications to interact with external resources.
- **Extensible Ecosystem**: Choose from hundreds of pre-built servers for popular tools like GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, and more. Easily build custom servers for bespoke integrations.
- **Seamless AI Integration**: Configure your AI application (Claude, VS Code, ChatGPT, etc.) to connect to MCP servers and access available tools, resources, and prompts.
- **Real Context, Real Actions**: AI-powered applications can access real data, execute actions, and provide more helpful responses based on your actual context.

## How MCP Works
1. **Choose MCP Servers**: Select from pre-built servers or create your own for custom workflows.
2. **Connect Your AI Application**: Configure your AI tool to connect to MCP servers and discover available resources.
3. **Work With Context**: Your AI application can now access and interact with real data and tools, enhancing its capabilities and usefulness.
